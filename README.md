# AMA564-project-code
Code part of project experiments

The code of first experiment is in the folder "/Slow Style Transfer/".

The scond is in "/Perceptual Loss Net/".

The third one is included in "MSG-Net", specifically, you can try this algorithm in functions.py since it's efficient and high-quality.
We encapsulates the image, video inference in it and camera demo, which can prove its real-time processing capability.

The code refers to the official implemantation of MSG-Net(https://github.com/zhanghang1989/PyTorch-Multi-Style-Transfer).

The anime folder includes testing code of animation style transfer based on Paddle-Hub. This part is not included in our presentation and report since we directly use others model.
